* ¿What is the purpose of the dependencies and dependency tags into the POM file?

The purpose of this tag is to read project files from the remote respositories specified

## Dependency Management

* Go to the MVNRepository and search fortika-core library. Add a new dependency to the POM file with the last version of this library.

As shown in the following image the dependency was added to the project

Transitive dependencies are dependencies required by our direct dependencies

* Using the terminal execute the command mvn package. Take the output screenshot. What is this command using for?

This command is used to build the project completely
